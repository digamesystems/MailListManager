<p>I'm John Price. It's nice to e-meet you.</p>

<p>I found your name on the <a href=https://www.casqa.org/resources/training/cgp-training-program/cgp-trainer-of-record-qualification>California Stormwater Quality Association</a> site as a Trainer of Record for QSDs and QSPs.</p>

<p>As a stormwater management professional, I thought you might be interested in a new tool my company is developing to help experts like yourself keep track of QPEs driving inspection requirements. We call it, <a href = https://qpeassistant.com/register>🌧️QPE Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>A little background:</p>

<p>My wife is a Civil Engineer who is also a QSD and QSP. We were talking about the new 2022 General Construction Permit requirements, and she mentioned the steps around predicting QPEs for her construction sites were rather tedious.</p>

<p>-- We have nerdy conversations. :)</p>

<p>When she mentioned that her firm had to make daily visits to the <a href=https://www.weather.gov/wrh/wxtable>National Weather Service</a> website for each of their construction sites and perform a set of manual calculations, I thought a little web application that automates this process might be useful.</p>

<p>And thus, <a href=https://qpeassistant.com>🌧️QPE Assistant</a> came to life!</p>

<p>🌧️QPE Assistant allows you to create and maintain your own list of sites, fine-tune their GPS locations, and run reports based on real-time data from the National Weather Service to predict upcoming QPEs for each of them over the next seven days.</p>

<p>The application is currently in Beta, and we're seeking experts like yourself to give it a try and provide feedback so we can improve it and add needed features.</p>

<p>During the Beta period, 🌧️QPE Assistant is completely FREE to registered users.</p>

<p>If you are curious to learn more, you can watch a short demo of 🌧️QPE Assistant in action: <a href = https://youtu.be/-2TVE1ksN14>Demo Video</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to give it a try, register for the free Beta trial at <a href = https://qpeassistant.com/register>🌧️QPE Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate your time.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
