<br>

I'm John Price, Co-Creator of QPE Assistant, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to the QPE Assistant Beta Program!<br>

<p>Now that you're all signed up, take a moment to explore our app. It's pretty straightforward.</p> 

<p>Start by creating a couple of sites - just use the approximate address as a starting point and then refine your locations using the cursor to specify the exact spot. Once saved, you can run a QPE report, which will give you a rundown of all your sites using real-time data from the National Weather Service.</p>

We're eager to hear your thoughts on what we've put together so far:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Is the app intuitive for you?</li>
  <li>Does the report format work well for your needs?</li>
  <li>Where do you think we could make improvements?</li>
  <li>Are there any new features you'd like to see?</li>
</ul>

<p>We've already had a few requests for automatic email notifications of upcoming events. Is this something that would interest you? We're considering adding an option for you to receive a daily report in your email each morning.</p>

<p>Thanks once again for signing up! We're looking forward to hearing from you and making QPE Assistant the best it can be.</p>
