<p>Hello, <first_name>.</p>

<p>I'm John Price. It's nice to e-meet you.</p> 

<p>I found your name on the <a href=https://www.casqa.org/resources/training/cgp-training-program/cgp-trainer-of-record-qualification>California Stormwater Quality Assosciation</a> site as a Trainer of Record for QSDs and QSPs.</p>

<p>As a stormwater management professional, I thought you might be interested in a new tool my company is developing to help engineers like yourself keep track of QPEs driving inspection requirements. We call it, <em><b>QPE Assistant</b></em>.</p>

<p>A little background:</p> 

<p>My wife is a Civil Engineer who is also a QSD and QSP. We were talking about the new 2022 General Construction Permit requirements and she mentioned the steps around predicting QPEs for her construction sites were rather tedious.</p> 

<p> - We have nerdy conversations. :) </p>

<p>When she mentioned that her firm had to make daily visits to the National Weather Service web site for each of their construction sites and perform a set of manual calculations, I decided to work with my team to make a little web appliction that automates this process.</p>

<p>So, we built <em><b>QPE Assistant</b></em>.</p>

<p><em><b>QPE Assistant</b></em> allows you to create and maintain your own list of sites, fine tune their GPS loctions and run reports based on real-time data from the National Weather Service to predict upcoming QPEs for each of them over the next seven days.</p>

<p>The application is currently in Beta, and we're seeking experts like yourself to give it a try and provide feedback so we can improve it and add needed features.</p>

<p>During the Beta period, <em><b>QPE Assistant</b></em> is completely FREE to registered users.</p>

<p>If you are curious to learn more, you can watch a short demo of <em><b>QPE Assistant</b></em> in action: <a href = https://youtu.be/-2TVE1ksN14>Demo Video</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to give it a try, register for the free Beta trial at <a href = https://qpeassistant.com/register>QPE Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate your time.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
